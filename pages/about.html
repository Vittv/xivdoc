                <p>I made this site so I could have a place to gather all relevant high-end duty resources at mine and everyone's disposal. Often times I feel it can be difficult to find them for the fights we are looking to study and clear. Sometimes a simple search is not enough. So, instead of googling everything and searching through discord servers for information, let me look for all of it and show you what I found best!</p>
                <p>I will do my best to keep this as updated as possible only with Party Finder Standard information.</p>

                <p>I would also like to add that I am nowhere near a hardcore player! I am your usual 9-12 hours a week raid static player that just wants to beat all the content! For the time being, this website will be purely focused on the high-end fights, it is not meant to be a massive project <em>yet</em> and shall grow as I see fit and/or if needed.</p>
