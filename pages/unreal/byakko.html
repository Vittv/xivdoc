But even if they're the same fight, as the years go by, <strong>sometimes</strong>, the pf standard strats and resolutions can change. That usually involves ignoring a mechanic by resolving it with Tank LB as well as other methods. Have in mind that in order to unlock these fights, you only ever need to beat its normal mode and have unlocked Faux Hollows in Idyllshire.</li>

Additionally, the group will have to deal with mechanics from Byakko, such as <strong>Storm Pulse</strong>, while focusing Byakko and ignoring the add and the orbs.
