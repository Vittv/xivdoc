# XIVDoc

An attempt to have all FFXIV related end game content resources and guides in one place, while following the Party Finder standard. All content used is properly referenced and credited to its creators. This will be updated over time with new content as the game grows.

The goal is to make a good enough resource bundle that makes googling around or looking over discord servers for strats / raidplans / toolboxes no longer necessary. But of course with such goal I understand it can be quite challenging to deliver the exact correct strats and pf preferences from the entire community. All content was grabbed from public resources while some of the explanations are my own.

Since pf changes and some people might not like x or y creator's strats, please let me know if there's anything I can do to improve the website. I just want the best possible resources out there, to make raiders' lives easier.

Remember this is NOT necessarily a guides website. While yes, some of its content will be very much like a guide, it is not what the standard is supposed to be. So not every fight will have a nice guide. This is merely a resource grabber, a place to reference and study from.

## Resources:

XIVDoc currently covers Ultimate, Savage, Extreme, Unreal, Chaotic, and Criterion Fights.

A simple project idea, looking to solve a big problem. Static website with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.
